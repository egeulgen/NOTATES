Signature,Proposed aetiology,Associated mutation classes and signatures,CommentsSBS1,An endogenous mutational process initiated by spontaneous or enzymatic deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine which generates G:T mismatches in double stranded DNA. Failure to detect and remove these mismatches prior to DNA replication results in fixation of the T substitution for C.,"The activity of SBS1 is closely correlated with the activity of SBS5 within many types of cancer. However, between cancer types, mutation burdens of SBS1 and SBS5 do not clearly correlate consistent with them being due to different underlying processes.",Signature SBS1 is clock-like in that the number of mutations in most cancers and normal cells correlates with the age of the individual. Rates of acquisition of Signature SBS1 mutations over time differ markedly between different cancer types and different normal cell types. These differences correlate with estimated rates of stem cell division in different tissues and Signature SBS1 may therefore be a cell division/mitotic clock.SBS2,"Attributed to activity of the AID/APOBEC family of cytidine deaminases on the basis of similarities in the sequence context of cytosine mutations caused by APOBEC enzymes in experimental systems. APOBEC3A is probably responsible for most mutations in human cancer, although APOBEC3B may also contribute (these differ in the sequence context two bases 5‰Ûª to the mutated cytosine, see 1,536 mutation classification signature extraction). SBS2 mutations may be generated directly by DNA replication across uracil or by error prone polymerases replicating across abasic sites generated by base excision repair removal of uracil.","SBS2 is closely associated with SBS13. SBS2 is also associated with DBS11, which is characterised predominantly by CC>TT doublet base substitutions as well as other CC>NN doublet base substitutions.
","SBS2 is usually found in the same samples as SBS13. It has been proposed that activation of AID/APOBEC cytidine deaminases in cancer may be due to previous viral infection, retrotransposon jumping, or tissue inflammation. Currently, there is limited evidence to support these hypotheses. Germline polymorphisms involving APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B are associated with predisposition to breast and bladder cancer as well as with mutation burdens of SBS2 and SBS13. Mutations of similar patterns to SBS2 and SBS13 are commonly found in the phenomenon of local hypermutation present in some cancers, known as kataegis, implicating AID/APOBEC enzymes in this process as well."SBS3,Defective homologous recombination-based DNA damage repair which manifests predominantly as small indels and genome rearrangements due to abnormal double strand break repair but also in the form of this base substitution signature.,"Associated with ID6, characterised by small deletions of >5bp with extended stretches of overlapping microhomology at breakpoint junctions. Also associated with multiple genome rearrangement mutational signatures; short tandem duplications (1-10kb); longer tandem duplications (>100kb); deletions (1-10kb).","SBS3 is strongly associated with germline and somatic BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations and BRCA1 promoter methylation in breast, pancreatic, and ovarian cancers. In pancreatic cancer, responders to platinum therapy usually exhibit SBS3 mutations. Together with associated indel and rearrangement signatures, SBS3 has been proposed as a predictor of defective homologous recombination-based repair and thus of response to therapies exploiting this repair defect."SBS4,"Associated with tobacco smoking. Its profile is similar to the mutational spectrum observed in experimental systems exposed to tobacco carcinogens such as benzo[a]pyrene. SBS4 is, therefore, likely due to direct DNA damage by tobacco smoke mutagens.","Associated with ID3, characterised by single base deletions of predominantly C, and with DBS2, characterised predominantly by CC>AA mutations.","Although tobacco smoking causes multiple cancer types in addition to lung and head and neck, SBS4 has not been detected in many of these. SBS29 is found in cancers associated with tobacco chewing and appears different from SBS4."SBS5,Unknown. SBS5 mutational burden is increased in bladder cancer samples with ERCC2 mutations and in many cancer types due to tobacco smoking.,N/A,SBS5 is clock-like in that the number of mutations in most cancers and normal cells correlates with the age of the individual. Rates of acquisition of SBS5 mutations over time differ between different cancer types and different normal cell types. These differences do not clearly correlate with estimated rates of stem cell division in different tissues nor with differences in SBS1 mutation rates. SBS5 may be contaminated by SBS16.SBS6,SBS6 is associated with defective DNA mismatch repair and is found in microsatellite unstable tumours.,"SBS6 is associated with large numbers of ID1 and ID2 mutations, which are characterised respectively by small (usually 1bp) insertions and deletions of T at mononucleotide T repeats.","SBS6 is one of seven mutational signatures associated with defective DNA mismatch repair (with microsatellite instability, MSI) and is often found in the same samples as other MSI associated signatures: SBS14, SBS15, SBS20, SBS21, SBS26, and SBS44."SBS7a,"SBS7a/SBS7b/SBS7c/SBS7d are found in cancers of the skin from sun exposed areas and are thus likely to be due to exposure to ultraviolet light. SBS7a may possibly be the consequence of just one of the two major known UV photoproducts, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or 6-4 photoproducts. However, there is currently no evidence for this hypothesis and it is unclear which of these photoproducts may be responsible for SBS7a.","SBS7a is associated with SBS7b/SBS7c/SBS7d and these signatures are commonly found in the same samples.

SBS7c is possibly the consequence of translesion DNA synthesis by enzymes with propensity to insert T, rather than A, opposite ultraviolet induced thymidine and cytidine photodimers. The preponderance of T>A rather than T>C mutations may reflect the heavier burden of thymidine compared to cytidine dimers induced by UV light.",SBS7c is associated with SBS7a/SBS7b/SBS7d and these signatures are commonly found in the same samples.,The larger number of whole genome samples now analysed allows splitting of SBS7 into four distinct components.
